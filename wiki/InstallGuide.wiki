JournlerWeb is not yet ready for prime time.  Installation requires several steps.  I hope to have an easier way to install soon.

For now, you have to install these separately but it shouldn't bee too difficult to make a single installer in the future. 

  # Install Python 2.4 from [http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/dmg/python-2.4.4-macosx2006-10-18.dmg here]. Check which version you currently have with `python -V`
  # Install appscript from [http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=appscript&filename=Appscript-Installer-1.5.1.dmg here]
  # Install Turbogears from [http://www.turbogears.com/download/ here]
  # Install Subversion (svn) from [http://metissian.com/downloads/macosx/subversion/subversion-client-1.3.1.dmg here]
  # Finally, install JournlerWeb by downloading [this] or using svn. If using svn, checkout the code and run `python setup.py install` or just run `start-journlerweb.py` to run from source directory.

To run JournlerWeb, run `start-journlerweb.py` in the terminal.
